Oracle today announced the availability of Java 17, the latest version of the world’s number one programming language
and development platform. Java 17 delivers thousands of performance, stability, and security updates, as well as
14 JEPs (JDK Enhancement Proposals) that further improve the Java language and platform to help developers be more
productive.
Java 17 is the latest long-term support (LTS) release under Java’s six-month release cadence and is the result of
extensive collaboration between Oracle engineers and other members of the worldwide Java developer community via
the OpenJDK Community and the Java Community Process (JCP). Since the previous JDK 11 LTS released three years ago,
over 70 JEPs have been implemented.
